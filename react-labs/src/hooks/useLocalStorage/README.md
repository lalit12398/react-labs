# useLocalStorage Hook

This hook creates a persistent piece of state that automatically syncs with localStorage, keeping UI reactive and up-to-date across reloads and sessions.

## Features

-   Lazy initialization of state to load from localStorage on first render.
-   Synchronized React state with localStorage on updates via useEffect.
-   Try-catch in getters and setters for error handling (e.g., JSON parse errors).
-   Returns [value, setValue] tuple, similar to useState, for easy integration.
-   Simple abstraction that combines React state and localStorage persistence.

## Use Case

-   Persist simple React state like user preferences, themes, form inputs.
-   Automatically update UI on state changes with persistent backing.
-   Ideal for typical React component state syncing with localStorage.

# useLocalStorageWithSetGet Hook

This variant adds manual control by exposing setter and getter methods, featuring access or update localStorage whenever needed, but should be used carefully to avoid losing Reactâ€™s auto reactivity

## Features

-   Includes all features of useLocalStorage state sync.
-   Explicit methods: setItem() for setting localStorage and state, getItem() to fetch the current value from localStorage directly.
-   Allows manual control over storage operations beyond automatic state sync.
-   Useful for cases needing explicit read/write calls separate from component state.

## Use Case

-   Access or update localStorage outside component lifecycle or React render.
-   Perform explicit read/write operations, e.g. in event handlers or effects.
-   Scenarios requiring direct localStorage management alongside reactive UI sync.
-   Handling complex cases with manual control over persistence timing.
